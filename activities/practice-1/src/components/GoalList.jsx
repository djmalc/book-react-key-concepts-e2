        I want to ensure, that you get the most out of this book and you learn
        all about React!

      <GoalItem title='Allow you to practice what you learned'>
        Reading and learning is fun and helpful but you only master a topic, if
        you really work with it! That's why I want to prepare many exercises
        that allow you to practice what you learned.
      </GoalItem>
      <GoalItem title='Motivate you to continue learning'>
        As a developer, learning never ends. I want to ensure that you enjoy
        learning and you're motivated to dive into advanced (React) resources
        after finishing this book. Maybe my complete React video course?
